#### Exercise 7

<https://launchschool.com/books/regex/read/character_classes#exercises>

Are `/(ABC|abc)/` and `/[Aa][Bb][Cc]/` equivalent regex? If not, how do they
differ? Can you provide an example of a string that would match one of these
regex, but not the other?

The first regex, `/(ABC|abc)/`, matches either `ABC` or `abc` but not strings
containing a mix of upper and lowercase, like `aBc`.

The second regex, `/[Aa][Bb][Cc]/`, matches strings containing any combination
up `A` or `a`, `B` or `b`, and `C` or `c`, in that order, so it would match a
string like `aBc`.
