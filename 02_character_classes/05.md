## Introduction to Regular Expressions

#### Exercise 5

<https://launchschool.com/books/regex/read/character_classes#exercises>

Why is `/[^xX]/` not a valid answer to the previous exercise?

The regex `/[^xX]/` matches any *character* not `x` or `X`, including symbols
and special characters. This isn't what we want. You could include all the
symbols and special characters in your character class along with `x` and `X`,
but it would be easy to forget one.
