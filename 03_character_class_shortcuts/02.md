#### Exercise 2

<https://launchschool.com/books/regex/read/class_shortcuts#exercises>

Test the pattern `/\s...\s/` from the previous exercise against the text below:

```txt
Doc in a big red box.
Hup! 2 3 4
```

```js
let string = (
`Doc in a big red box.
Hup! 2 3 4`
);

console.log(string.match(/\s...\s/g)); // => [' big ', ' 2 3 ']
```

Observe that one of the three-letter words in this text match the pattern; it
also matches `2 3`. Why is it that this pattern doesn't include the three-letter
words `Doc`, `red`, `box` or `Hup`, but it does match `2 3`?

`Doc`: The pattern doesn't match this string because it only has trailing
whitespace.

`red`: The pattern doesn't match this string because having already matched
` big `, the space following `big` and preceding `red` has already been
consumed.

`box`: The pattern doesn't match this string because it only has leading
whitespace.

`Hup`: The pattern doesn't match this string because it only has leading
whitespace, a newline character, `\n`.
